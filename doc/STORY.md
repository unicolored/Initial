Hi, welcome to Initial. I'm Gilles Hoarau and i want to make the Web a better place. You too ? Well, you'll love Initial. Join the project as a user or a contributor, but certainly as a webMaster. You are now an Inimaster, et voilà :)
You'll find the project on github. The main site, for iniMasters only, is here. The bookmarklet instructions are below.

The idea is simple : connect your website with Initial, to the iniMasters community and show-off your work. Share ideas and much about the World Wide Web between verified webmasters only.
With Initial, you can also comment and rate any website by opening it with our bookmarklet. Let's share these comments with all Inimasters.

Now let your visitors access your unique customizable Initial console in a modal window onto your site. Put your own commands and stylesheet or choose from the given one, and share along with public and the Initial community.

More to come : 
-basic commands : let you open iframes, deliver messages, show ascii Art
-advanced commandes : pagespeed, w3c validator
-apps : launch games and apps developped by the iniMasters, inside your own terminal to let your visitor have fun !

Instructions :

Initial use the humans.org semantic to give credits to your website. You don't use one ? Don't worry, just read this few lines and let's create a human.txt for your website including the IniDomain parameter. It's the safe way to Initialize.
